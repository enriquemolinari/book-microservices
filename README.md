## Microservices Architecture Style

### Movies Microservices

- `git clone https://github.com/enriquemolinari/book-microservices.git`
- `cd book-microservices`
- To compile and install all dependencies: `mvn install`
- To run all service tests: `mvn test`
- To start the service: `mvn exec:java`. A sample movie data is loaded at startup.
